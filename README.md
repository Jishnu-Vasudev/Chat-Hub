# Chat-Hub
This project aims to create a Chatbot and a Chatapp and chatbot to combine it to an integrated ChatHub using Python Programming Language.
The Chatbot uses a Gemni API to access the content from Google Gemni and display it in a chat based GUI.
The Chatapp uses socket module to implement a server that shall work as a mean of communication for clients. Currently due to the lack of a proper server, the Chatapp uses localhost as a server, due to which communication is only possible between instances in the same system.
The file used are:
1. ChatHub.py (Under-development) : The integrated interface for ChatApp and ChatHub
2. Chatbot.py (Under-development) : Code for Chatbot
3. server.py : The server code for the Chatapp
4. client.py : The client code for the Chaapp
